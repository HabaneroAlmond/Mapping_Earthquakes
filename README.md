# Mapping Earthquakes

This was a fun and rewarding challenge where we were able to take what we learned in javascript/web development and combine it with GEOjson to create an interactive map of earthquake data. 

Below you can see a snapshot of the final product. This a multi layer map showing earthquake locations as well as the tectonic plate boundaries. It allows the viewer to easily see relations between the location of tectonic plates and earthquake locations. It also has a legend in the bottom right corner which differentiates the magnitude of the earthquakes. You can also view the map in three different options, for ours we offered three different viewing modes - 'streets', 'satellite' (seen below), and 'light'.

Included in this repository are some of the other exercises we did to build up to this point.
